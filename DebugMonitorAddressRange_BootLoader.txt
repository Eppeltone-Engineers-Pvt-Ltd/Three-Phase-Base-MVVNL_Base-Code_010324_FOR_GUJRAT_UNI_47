BootLoader settings:

In the property of CC-Rl Build Tool -> Link Options -> Device
there is a facility to 

Device
Set enable/disable on-chip debug by link option : YES
Set debug monitor area				: Yes(Specify address range)(-DEBUG_MONITOR=<Address Range>
Range of debug monitor area			: 3DE0 - 3FE0
Set User Option Byte				: Yes(-USR_OPT_BYTE)
User Option Byte Value				: 7E39E0
Control allocation to self RAM area		: No
Control allocation to control RAM area		: No

If we do not want the On Chip Debug option as WARNED by Renesas in Chapter 37 (ON-CHIP DEBUG FUNCTION)

then it is not sufficient to only set enable/disable on-chip debug by link option to NO
It is also required that Set debug monitor area be also set to No.

i.e
Set enable/disable on-chip debug by link option : NO
Set debug monitor area				: NO
Set User Option Byte				: Yes(-USR_OPT_BYTE)
User Option Byte Value				: 7E39E0
Control allocation to self RAM area		: No
Control allocation to control RAM area		: No


There seems to be some difference in the settings for the Application code (wonder why?)
Application settings

Set enable/disable on-chip debug by link option : NO
Set debug monitor area				: NO
Set User Option Byte				: Yes(-USR_OPT_BYTE)
User Option Byte Value				: 7E39E0
Control allocation to self RAM area		: Yes(Error message)(-SELF)
Control allocation to control RAM area		: No
